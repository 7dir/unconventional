* **Introduction**
  + 3 reasons why I'm excited about speaking at JekyllConf
    1. My first PR, thanks for making me feel welcome
    2. My website --job at--> Mapbox
    3. I get to use Jekyll every day
  + Why I like using Jekyll for everything
    - easy to start up
    - greater control
    - there's a finite number of things, but it feels infinite in the way you can combine them
    - have a problem to solve is the best way to learn
  + my talk will focus on some of the problems I wanted to solve with Jekyll and they happen to be focused around mapping
* **1st problem: adventures map**
  - how can I create a single map from adventure posts
  - big realization: jekyll-ize a js file + walk-through explanation
* **2nd problem: how can i weave this data**
  - country/state data: looping through data files to create a new source
  - i'd rather spend an hour making something smart and scalable, than spend twenty minutes doing manual input
* **3rd problem: is this possible, fast prototyping**
  - jonas data: looping through data files
* **4th problem: unit testing for silly projects**
  - emoji frame: looping through static files
